# st-lightRail-map

This is a side project insipred by https://github.com/waldenhillegass/link-map. This is a dispaly of the Link light rail transit system using stuff I learned from project odin to display on to a monitor using a raspberry pi.

Once you obtain a api key you then need to make a .env file in root and fill it with your API key. example line "API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE".
